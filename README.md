Test Hosting For A Website I'm Making...

Patch #1:
Added HTML Form to Google Sheets compatibility.

Future Updates:
Making the login page work.
Adding PHP to make the login button switch to logout once you login.

Also, if you'd like to use any of this code for your own website, all I ask is that you let me know at UnspeakableDud@gmail.com.
